This website is currently under construction - please contact me if you'd like to know more about my work.

I am a NRF Innovation Postdoctoral Fellow at the Africa Open Institute for Music, Research and Innovation at Stellenbosch University, South Africa. I completed her PhD studies in March 2024 under the guidance of Dr Carina Venter and Prof. Stephanus Muller with a dissertation considering the intellectual history of institutionalised music studies in 20th-century South Africa.

I am currently furthering my research into the intellectual history of institutionalised music studies in South Africa. This research is energised by various recent efforts to understand the influence of South Africa’s troubled colonial and apartheid history on the shaping of academic disciplines and discourses. In particular, I am concerned with the establishment and consolidation of the discipline, the work of individuals instrumental in this project, the various ideologies at play in institutions such as music departments as well as the ways in which the discipline has responded to political transitions and paradigm shifts in scholarship. It is envisioned that this systematic overview of institutionalised music studies in South Africa will assist scholars in their efforts to grapple with the pasts, present and futures of the discipline. My broader research interests include decolonial thought, intellectual and institutional histories and their relation to discourses of apartheid and colonialism as well as archival research.

I hold BMus: Performing Arts (Cum Laude) degree from Nelson Mandela University, where I specialised in clarinet performance. Here I received the Nelson Mandela University Council Award for Best First Degree in the Faculty of Arts as well as Vice-Chancellor’s Medal for the best First-Degree Graduate in the university in 2019. After a move to Stellenbosch University, I completed her MMus: Musicology (Cum Laude) in 2020 under the guidance of Dr Carina Venter, with a thesis investigating the decolonisation of the BMus curricula of four South African tertiary music departments. I have lectured World Music, Research Methodology and Musicology at Stellenbosch University. I am also the current secretary of the South African Society for Research in Music (SASRIM), as well as a member of the Exco.
