abstract={This article critically examines the institutionalisation of decolonial discourse within neoliberal academic institutions following the #MustFall protests that broke out in 2015 in South Africa. Drawing predominantly on the work of numerous theorists from the Global South, I argue that the institutionalisation of decolonisation has led to its commodification and deradicalisation. I also consider the ways in which decolonial discourse itself is problematic through its recurring production of existing unequal knowledge economies leading to the continued prioritisation of the work of scholars based in the Global North. In thinking through how these difficulties can be navigated, I turn to the South African digital publication herri as a case study. Although hosted by Stellenbosch University, herri counters the threat of deradicalisation through several unique strategies. Through examination of these strategies, herri is positioned as an alternative model of decolonial cultural production that both responds to and reflects on academia’s broader systemic limitations. This article calls for similar initiatives that promote transformative, Global South-led voices outside conventional frameworks.}

 abstract={ As a master's student investigating curricular decolonisation at South African tertiary music departments, I found myself in a chain of fear driven by previous contestations of similar critical projects. Despite stringently following the institutional ethics requirements, ethical concerns regarding the critical content of my work were still raised, perpetuating this fear. In this article, I discuss my concerns that the issues raised stemmed from an environment in which moral knowledge has become codified in a template for ethical research. I consider the problems that occur when ethical procedures such as anonymity, protecting ‘vulnerable’ interviewees and member checking become mere tick-boxes on a template for ethical research, as well as how such templates can become a method of imbuing fear into the researcher. In conclusion, I propose the development of an ethical praxis premised on an ethics of care that enables, rather than stymies, critical research.}

 abstract={Despite several recent contributions by South African music studies scholars regarding the lack of curricular transformation in South African tertiary music departments and the ongoing hegemonic superiority of Western art music ( Stolp 2015, 2016; Mapaya 2016; Viviers 2017; Fourie et al. 2018; King 2018), the extent, or lack, of post-apartheid curricular transformation at South African music departments has not yet been the subject of systematic scrutiny. This article begins to address this gap by means of a critical post-apartheid curriculum history of the music departments at four institutions - Stellenbosch University, Nelson Mandela University, the University of Cape Town and the University of KwaZulu-Natal. Following the work of Agbedahin and Agbedahin (2019), I argue that such a critical curriculum history can significantly contribute to curriculum transformation. I start by surveying existing literature on the state of the South African tertiary music curriculum. By means of an examination of yearbooks as well as interviews with current and past staff members, the curriculum at each of the included departments is then surveyed. I then focus on four particular areas of interest, namely the bureaucratic nature of many of the curricular changes, the continued marginalisation of nontraditional modules, the optimisation of choice as part of curriculum change strategies which then becomes part of a neo-liberal ethos (and within a certain environment runs the risk of the continuation of established patterns, albeit now as optional rather than mandatory) and the persistence of problematic terminology. Finally, I offer an analysis of the surveyed changes in terms of Cross's (2004) add-on, affirmative and critical transformative approaches to curriculum change.  }

 abstract={Several recent publications on South African music by internationally based scholars have been recognised with major international awards.1 Noel Lobley's Sound Fragments: From Field Recording to African Electronic Stories continued this trend, winning both the Society for Ethnomusicology's 2023 Bruno Nettl and Ruth Stone prizes (the latter shared with Jessica Perrea's Sound Relations), and the International Association for the Study of Popular Music 2023 Book Prize. Based on Lobley's doctoral research (completed in 2010), this ethnographic enquiry takes as its point of departure the archival sound recording, what Lobley terms the sound fragment. Whereas scholars have often focused on the social, political and economic efects of the fragmentation of such records from their social environments, Lobley argues that it also results in a 'plasticity' (6) that opens not only new ways of thinking about and listening to sound archives, but also new spaces in which a wider audience can do so. Using Hugh Tracey's Sound of Africa record series and the International Library for African Music (ILAM) as a case study, Sound Fragments explores the possibilities of expanding the archival record through 'processes of creative decolonisation' (1) in the form of '[c] ollaborative curation that translates between local artistic practice and institutional archival processes' (127). The resultant decolonial archive, Lobley proposes, would both 'include and enhance … the lived world of communities whose expressive culture was documented, then taken, sampled, and pointed somewhere else' (127).  }
